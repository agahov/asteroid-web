## ECS Component Management Rules

When adding a new component to an entity, always use `addComponent(world, ComponentName, entityId)` from bitecs. Never use direct assignment like `ComponentName[entityId] = value` for adding components.

**Correct way:**
```typescript
import { addComponent } from "bitecs";
addComponent(world, RemoveMark, entityId);
```

**Incorrect way:**
```typescript
RemoveMark[entityId] = 1; // This is wrong for adding components
```

**Note:** Direct assignment is only for modifying existing component data, not for adding components to entities.
